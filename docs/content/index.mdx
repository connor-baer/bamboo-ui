# Bamboo UI

[Bamboo UI](https://bamboo.connor.li) is a collection of React components and utils that I use across my various web projects to save development time and provide a consitency experience to the users. It is heavily inspired by and built on top of [⚡️ Circuit UI](https://circuit.sumup.com).
