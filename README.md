# [ðŸŽ‹ Bamboo UI](https://bamboo.madebyconnor.co) <!-- omit in toc -->

[Bamboo UI](https://bamboo.madebyconnor.co) is a collection of React components and utils that I use across my various web projects to save development time and provide a consitency experience to the users.

    const button = create(<Button />);
    expect(button).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
  it('should take the body text as a child', () => {
    const output = mount(<Button onClick={() => {}}>Hello World</Button>);
    expect(output.text()).toContain('Hello World');
  });
});
```

## Utils

Besides the component library, we also export some utilities which you
might need in order to use the components. The main ones:

- `sharedPropTypes` - a module with common prop types used in the components.
- `themeHelpers` - a module containing helpers for generating a theme.
- `isServer` - a module that checks whether the code is running on a server.
- `isSaveData` - a module that checks the user's network speed and preferences.

## Creating components

This project uses [@sumup/foundry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/foundry) and the provided `plop` command to generate new React components. The functionality is exposed as the `create:component` npm script from package.json.

To create a new component, run `yarn create:component` inside the project. You'll see a CLI that guides you through the process.

After the CLI has finished, all files will have been created in the location you specified.
